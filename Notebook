I have a bunch of images in form of jpg and png in a directory. These images are photos taken by a phone camera, as such a lot of these photos display the date of the time they were taken and it looks something like the following example 02/05/2023. Each one represents a photo of an etiquette or a label that sometimes has a QR code and a bunch of information about a product. These stickers contain specific information about different products. Please note that the language used on these etiquettes or  labels is mostly German and sometimes English. I will give you some examples about the kind of information these images have;

Artikelname
Artikelnummer
MHD (Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum)
Einfrierdatum
Einfrierdatum Erntejahr
LAX
Produktionscode 
Batch
Lot

The goal is to programmatically retrieve all the information that are on the label. I don't exactly know yet what kind of technology this requires. I would appreciate you giving me possible ways to find a proper solution. You can for example suggest services and technologies that gets the job done. Please make a plan with detailed steps to go about it.

Please note that the displayed date of the time the photos were taken (mostly visible/shown in the bottom right corner of the image) is not of any importance, which means that it should be ignored.

Please also do let me know if you require any other information from me to find a proper solution.
For now and for testing purposes I need you to provide me with a free plan to do the job.


I need my data to be printed out in a user-friendly manner. Preferably in a bullet point format.

Since each image is unique our code has to be flexible and smart when dealing with the images. Which means that if a "Lot" or a "production date" is not present or missing on the etiquette, the code has to inform me as such. For example the code can return a message saying "Information not available". The messages should be displayed in two different sections. The first section should be on the left side of the document and written in German. The second section should be on the right side of the document and written in English. I'm specifically talking about the following data that the code should return:

Artikelname
Artikelnummer
MHD (Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum)
Einfrierdatum
Erntejahr
LAX
Produktionscode 
Batch
Lot

The validateAndCleanData function is not necessary for the job. It was included as an example to demonstrate how you can add validation and cleaning logic to the extracted data if needed.

If you don't require any specific data validation or cleaning operations, you can omit the validateAndCleanData function from your code. It is not essential for the main task of extracting information from the text and writing it to a CSV file.

To extract information from the images containing etiquettes or labels, you can follow a step-by-step approach using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text processing techniques. Here's a plan outlining the process:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Iterate through the images in the directory.
   - Apply image preprocessing techniques like resizing, denoising, and enhancing to improve OCR accuracy.
   - Convert the images to grayscale or black-and-white if necessary.

2. **OCR Processing:**
   - Utilize an OCR library or service to extract text from the images. Popular OCR libraries include Tesseract, OCRopus, and Google Cloud Vision OCR.
   - Ensure that the OCR solution supports both German and English languages to handle the multilingual labels.
   - Extract the recognized text and store it for further processing.

3. **Text Parsing and Extraction:**
   - Analyze the extracted text to identify relevant information based on the given examples.
   - Implement parsing algorithms or regular expressions to extract specific fields such as Artikelname, Artikelnummer, MHD, Einfrierdatum, etc.
   - Account for variations in how the information may appear, allowing for different date formats or label layouts.

4. **Language Processing (Optional):**
   - If required, perform language processing techniques to differentiate between German and English text.
   - This can involve using language detection libraries or implementing language-specific rules for identifying and handling different languages.

5. **Data Validation and Cleaning:**
   - Validate the extracted information for correctness and integrity.
   - Implement sanity checks to verify the extracted data against known patterns or expected formats.
   - Clean the data by removing unnecessary characters, whitespace, or noise.

6. **Storage or Integration:**
   - Decide how you want to store or utilize the extracted data.
   - You may consider options like storing the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database) or integrating it into an existing system or database.

7. **Iterative Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test the solution on a subset of images, validate the results, and iterate on any necessary improvements.
   - Monitor the performance and adjust the preprocessing steps, OCR settings, or text parsing logic accordingly.

Regarding the technologies and services, here are some suggestions:

- **OCR Libraries**: Tesseract OCR, OCRopus
- **Cloud OCR Services**: Google Cloud Vision OCR, Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services OCR, AWS Rekognition (Check the availability of multilingual support for German and English)
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- **Language Processing Libraries**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), spaCy, language-detection (Java library)
- **Data Storage or Integration**: CSV, Excel, SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Remember to consider the terms and conditions, pricing, and any limitations or requirements of the services you choose.
